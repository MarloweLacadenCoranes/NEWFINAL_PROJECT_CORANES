        <h2>Why Was This Website Made?</h2>
        <p>We believe that a lot of children lack quality education in many countries, even in today's day and age.
        So this website tries to spread awareness for the children and people who do not get this education.
        We raise awareness by stating the different problems that this situation could give us.
